## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - Svelte
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Utility Framework

### What I learned

These little projects always remind me that structuring HTML properly for responsiveness is a challenge depending on the design. The most complicated part for me tends to be the structure of the outermost container because it sets how everything inside of it will react. Luckily in this project, I managed to wrap everything and fix the layout with realitive ease but I need to find a better strategy to building out the responsive layout correctly at the start. Since I build mobile first, I tend to get the mobile view going and load some of the basic components. By the time I've loaded most of the content, I forget to go and check that my layout will work at the largest breakpoints. I'll need to try something different on my next project.

I also took time to try to write the components in a way that would import content from a database instead of hard coding it. I actually find that to be the most enjoyable part. It feels great when the code you've written is being reused as much as possible. On larger projects, this has been such a great feeling and a massive relief to realize I don't have to write much new code, if any.

### Continued development 

Working on more complicated designs is something I need to do more of. Using component libraries as well and finding a stack that I like is something that I'll need to work on. There are just so many different tools that exist now that its hard to find good ones that really do the job. I also find that I need to spend more time using CSS Grid to learn more of its quirks. Tailwind has been a great asset and I want to keep improving my skills using it in my projects.
